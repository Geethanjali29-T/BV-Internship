AI/ML Internship Projects
Welcome to my hands-on AI/ML internship repository! This collection includes fundamental machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch and using scikit-learn, each with clear objectives and supporting visualizations. Below is an overview of the tasks completed during the internship.New projects will be added regularly as I progress through the internship.
